## Research and Analysis

I conducted in-depth interviews with 8 current users across different technical backgrounds to understand the spectrum of observability needs. The research revealed a clear pattern: technical complexity was the primary barrier to APM adoption across organizations.

## Design Solution: Progressive Complexity

Rather than dumbing down the tool, I designed a progressive complexity system that adapts to user expertise levels. This approach ensures both novices and experts can achieve their monitoring goals effectively.

## Design System Contributions

Beyond the core APM experience, I contributed illustrations and design patterns to Grafana's design system, establishing visual principles that communicate complex observability concepts through approachable, intuitive interfaces.

The illustration work focused on reducing cognitive load for new users while maintaining the technical precision that expert users require. This dual approach became a foundational principle for subsequent observability product development at Grafana.
