<CompText>
Current users reported frustration with the app's cluttered navigation and lack of clear goals. Our analysis showed a significant drop-off rate among less technical users, with many abandoning the app after just one week.

## Research and Analysis

I conducted in-depth interviews with 8 current users and observed a common pain point: difficulty navigating some of our applications to find information tailored to their monitoring goals. Our analysis revealed that less technical users preferred visual and interactive ways of exploring content.

## Design Solution

I employed a user-centered design approach, focusing on simplicity and discoverability. I've introduced a new onboarding feature that utilizes simple steps with minimal technical jargon, tailored to users' goals and tech savvy-ness levels.

Besides creating innovative design patterns, I also contributed to the design system and had the opportunity to create illustrations that support the idea of simplicity and visual appeal.
