# GRAFANA: Enhancing Observability Experiences

## Overview

During my time contributing to Grafana Labs, I worked on multiple projects spanning dashboard design, plugin systems, and user experience improvements. This collection showcases key projects that enhanced monitoring and observability workflows for millions of users.

## Featured Projects

### Dashboard Redesign
Complete overhaul of the dashboard creation experience, focusing on reducing complexity while maintaining power-user capabilities.

### Frontend Application Observability
Building a Real User Monitoring solution that leveraged unique capabilities to meet the needs of both seasoned DevOps and SRE teams, as well as less technical users adopting observability practices.

### Application Observability
Simplifying APM for technical and non-technical users through intuitive onboarding flows and streamlined dashboard interfaces, reducing user drop-off by 70%.

### Cloud Onboarding
Revamped onboarding experience to address the fact that 62% of users were unfamiliar with key products like Loki, Mimir, and Tempo, resulting in 40% fewer support requests.

### Plugin System Evolution
Redesigned the plugin architecture and developer experience, making it easier for the community to extend Grafana's capabilities.

### Alert Management Interface
Streamlined alert configuration and management for enterprise teams managing thousands of monitoring rules.
