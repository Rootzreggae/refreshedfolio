<CompText>
Through extensive research with 87 developers, I identified critical gaps in API key management and built an open-source solution that prioritizes security without sacrificing usability. The project demonstrates my ability to spot market opportunities, execute end-to-end product design, and bridge technical complexity with human-centered solutions.

I surveyed 87 developers across Reddit, Lemmy, and professional networks and discovered that 68% manage API keys in spreadsheets or sticky notes, 91% have experienced security incidents from poor key management, and 76% find existing solutions "unnecessarily complex".

## Design Process

My design process focused on creating a simple, developer-focused interface that prioritizes security without sacrificing usability. The key insight was that existing tools are "Swiss army knives" - overcomplicated and overpriced for most development teams.

I broke down the problem into core design principles:
1. **10-Second Overview** - Critical information visible instantly
2. **Progressive Disclosure** - Complexity available when needed
3. **Proactive Security** - Guide users toward best practices
4. **Developer Aesthetics** - Dark mode first, information dense

## Implementation & Impact

50 developers tested the prototype over 4 weeks with impressive results:
- 96% successfully added and managed keys without documentation
- Average setup time: 5 minutes
- Time saved: 3.4 hours/month per developer
- NPS Score: 72 (vs. industry average of 31)

The project proves I don't just design interfaces - I identify problems worth solving, validate solutions with real users, and execute with business impact in mind. This open-source approach demonstrates my ability to build trust through transparency, which is crucial for security tools.
