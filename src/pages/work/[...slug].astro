/**
 * DISABLED: Unified Project Router
 *
 * This file handled content collection routes but has been disabled during migration
 * to Astro page-based project structure. Projects are now handled as direct Astro pages
 * in /src/pages/projects/ to eliminate content collection conflicts.
 *
 * Migration notes:
 * - Individual project pages are now in /src/pages/projects/
 * - Category pages use index.astro files in subdirectories
 * - This eliminates the need for content collection routing
